# Guessing Game

A simple number guessing game built with JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess what that number is. The user is given hints to help them narrow down or increase their guesses. The game ends when the user correctly guesses the number or runs out of guesses.
This project was inspired by the idea of a number guessing game and was created as a learning exercise in JavaScript programming.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
3. Enter your guess in the input field provided and click the "Guess" button.
4. The game will provide you with feedback and hints based on your guess:
   - If your guess is too low, it will display a message to guess higher.
   - If your guess is too high, it will display a message to guess lower.
   - If your guess is correct, it will display a congratulatory message.
5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number or run out of guesses.
6. If you run out of guesses, the game will reveal the correct number and display a message indicating that you have lost.
7. To play again, simply refresh the page.
